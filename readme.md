## FIAP - Datathon

- Student: Tadeu H. T. Junior
- Course: Pos-Tech in Artificial Intelligence & Data Engineering

### Introduction

The Passos Mágicos Association has a 31-year history of working to transform the lives of low-income children and young people, helping them access better life opportunities.

The transformation, envisioned by Michelle Flues and Dimetri Ivanoff, began in 1992, working within orphanages in the municipality of Embu-Guaçu.

In 2016, after years of activity, they decided to expand the program so that more young people could have access to this magical formula for transformation, which includes: quality education, psychological/psychopedagogical support, broadening their worldview, and fostering leadership. They then began operating as a social and educational project, thus creating the Passos Mágicos Association.

### Objective

The main objective of the Datathon is for you, as a data scientist, to create a predictive proposal or, as a data analyst, to develop an analytical proposal to demonstrate the impact that the NGO "Passos Mágicos" has been making on the community it serves. The association seeks to empower the use of education as a tool for changing the living conditions of children and young people in social vulnerability. Based on the extensive research dataset on educational development from the period of 2020, 2021, and 2023, you can deliver one of the following proposals:

Analytical Proposal: Create a storytelling to demonstrate the impacts that the NGO "Passos Mágicos" has had on student performance and raise performance indicators. The idea is to create a dashboard and storytelling by telling a story with the data to help Passos Mágicos make the best decisions based on the indicators and to understand the students' profiles.

Predictive Proposal: Create a predictive model to foresee student behavior based on some variables that may be crucial for identifying student development. In the predictive proposal, you can use creativity to propose a solution with a supervised or unsupervised algorithm. The idea is to use the knowledge learned in the course as a solution (machine learning, deep learning, or natural language processing).
